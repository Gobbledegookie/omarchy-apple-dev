# Run an xtool project on an iPhone from Omarchy Linux.
# Run this from inside your xtool project directory (the one with xtool.yml).
# First run ever: do `xtool auth` once beforehand (interactive Apple ID sign-in).
#
# Modes:
#   ./device-run.sh                        USB (default; the proven path)
#   ./device-run.sh --network [--udid U]   WiFi, phone on the SAME network.
#       TESTED 2026-09-16 and BLOCKED on stock iOS 18 (see FINDINGS.md 17):
#       discovery needs the phone to advertise _remoted._tcp over Bonjour,
#       and the phone only does that after "Connect via Network" was enabled
#       for it once from a Mac running Xcode (an Xcode-gated switch). With
#       Developer Mode on, paired over USB, unlocked, same SSID and subnet,
#       and an active USB RSD tunnel, a never-Xcoded phone still advertises
#       only the legacy _apple-mobdev2._tcp lockdown service — which Linux
#       usbmuxd cannot bridge. If your phone HAS been Xcode-enabled, this
#       mode should work; otherwise use USB or the tunneld bridge below.
#   ./device-run.sh --rsd HOST PORT PKG    install+launch an already-signed
#       .app/.ipa against an explicit RemoteServiceDiscovery address -- the
#       only piece that can address a phone by IP (e.g. over Tailscale), and
#       only if the phone exposes RSD on that interface (same _remoted gating
#       as --network; the USB tunnel from `remote tunneld` also provides an
#       RSD endpoint usable this way).
#       PKG must be signed with a real certificate: xtool's free-provisioning
#       signing only happens inside `xtool dev run`.
#
# Tailscale: mDNS discovery does not cross tailscale0, and Apple's remoted
# binds the phone's LAN interface, so a phone reachable only via Tailscale is
# not directly deployable. The supported remote pattern is pymobiledevice3's
# tunneld WebSocket bridge -- on a machine that CAN see the phone (USB or
# same LAN):
#     sudo pymobiledevice3 remote tunneld        # prints its WS port
# then, from the remote host:
#     pymobiledevice3 apps install PKG --tunnel UDID@BRIDGE_HOST:WS_PORT
#     pymobiledevice3 developer core-device launch-application BID "" \
#         --tunnel UDID@BRIDGE_HOST:WS_PORT
